# tailwind-play-html

This is a repo I created to test out Tailwind features in the simplest way possible - with a simple
HTML file and a setup to build the CSS prior to putting the static files online.

I am going to use this for experimentation.

To use the repo using the GitHub CLI do the following command:

`gh repo create <new-repo-name> --public --template tailwind-play-html`
