# tailwind-play-html

This is a repo I created to test out Tailwind features in the simplest way possible - with a simple
HTML file and a setup to build the CSS prior to putting the static files online.

I am going to use this for experimentation.

To use the repo using the GitHub CLI do the following command:

`gh repo create <new-repo-name> --public --template tailwind-play-html`

Clone the repo down and `cd` into it.

Then run:

```bash
yarn

# Followed by:

yarn build

```

Replace starter content and go for it.
